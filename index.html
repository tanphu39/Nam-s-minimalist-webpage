                <h1>What Is a Minimalist Lifestyle?<br>Experts Share the Potential Benefits</h1>

                <p>Minimalist living—or simplistic living—is nothing new. The concept, which involves freeing yourself from clutter and, to put it colloquially, "stuff," has been around for some time. In fact, you can find mentions of minimalism throughout history. (Buddhists, for example, tend to shun material possessions, and have for thousands of years.) However, the practice didn't become mainstream until the 20th century, when writers, photographers, beatniks, architects, and most importantly artists embraced the idea. According to the New York Times, the minimalist movement began in the art world.</p>
